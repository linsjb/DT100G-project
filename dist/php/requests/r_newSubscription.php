* Description:
* Logic for a new subscription.
*
* The data is collected from the form field's.
* First the tires data is collacted and a query is made for this.
* Then the array for the subscription data is created.
* The data is then sent to the newSub method in the
* subscriptions class.
*
* After the data is treated the page is redirected to the same page.
* To simulate a page refresh. So the new subscription is visible
* without a manual refresh of the page.
